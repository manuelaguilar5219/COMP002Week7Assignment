// 1. Write a console.log() statement that answers the following question: What worked
// well for you over the last 9 weeks that aided in your learning process?

console.log(
  "What worked well for you over the last 9 weeks that aided in your learning process?"
);
console.log("I think something that aided me was being comfortable with those around me. I was able to ask questions to others and I think that was helpful.");

// 2. Write a console.log() statement that answers the following question: What would you
// change about the course?

console.log("What would you change about the course?");
console.log("I wouldn't say that I would change anything specifically but it did go by rather quick. Yes I know that it was an 8 week course but maybe I would've preferred a slightly longer class.");

// 3. Write a console.log() statement that answers the following question: Did you learn
// what you expected to learn in this course?

console.log("Did you learn what you expected to learn in this course?");
console.log("I'm gonna say no. The only reason I say that is because I had never worked with JavaScript so I didn't really know what to expect when it came to the course and what I would learn,");

// 4. Write a console.log() statement that answers the following question: What concepts
// were new to you and what concepts had you encountered already in the past?

console.log(
  "What concepts were new to you and what concepts had you encountered already in the past?"
);
console.log("Everything in this class was new to me. I had zero experience with JavaScript");
